    <p>This page provides an overview of AEM EDS blocks </p>

     <pre>


         
AEM EDS(Edge Delivery Services) Blocks:


AEM Edge Delivery Service The block should [briefly describe the purpose of the block, e.g., 'display a formatted quote,' 'show a product listing,' 'embed a video player'].


There are following guidelines for the blocks:

1. A CSS file: Named '[block name].css'. It should [describe the styling requirements, e.g., 'have a dark background and white text,' 'use a specific font,' 'be responsive on mobile devices']. Include comments in the code.

2. A JavaScript file: Named '[block name].js'. It should [describe the functionality, e.g., 'take the content and format it into a quote,' 'fetch product data from an API,' 'initialize a video player based on the content']. Use vanilla JavaScript. Include comments in the code. Explain what the code does, step by step.

3. A README.md file: Explaining how to use the block. Include how to define the block in a Google Doc or Word document to create the layout, any variations that can be used with the block and instructions on using the block in a Google Doc or Word document.

4. The block name is '[block name]' and put it in the '[block name]' folder under the /blocks directory. The content structure will look like this in the Google Doc [describe or show a simple example of the table structure you'd use in a Google Doc or Word document to define the block, e.g., 'a two-column table with the quote text in the first column and the author in the second column. The first row should be the block name.'].

                    }
                    return response.text();
                })
                .then(data => {
                    document.getElementById(blockId).textContent = data;
                })
                .catch(error => {
                    document.getElementById(blockId).textContent = 'Error loading content: ' + error.message;
                });
        }

        // Load content for each block
        loadBlockContent('block1-content', 'blocks.txt');
        // Add more blocks as needed
    </script>
